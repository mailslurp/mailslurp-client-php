# # CreateInboxRulesetOptions

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**scope** | **string** | What type of emails actions to apply ruleset to. Either &#x60;SENDING_EMAILS&#x60; or &#x60;RECEIVING_EMAILS&#x60; will apply action and target to any sending or receiving of emails respectively. | 
**action** | **string** | Action to be taken when the ruleset matches an email for the given scope. For example: &#x60;BLOCK&#x60; action with target &#x60;*&#x60; and scope &#x60;SENDING_EMAILS&#x60; blocks sending to all recipients. Note &#x60;ALLOW&#x60; takes precedent over &#x60;BLOCK&#x60;. &#x60;FILTER_REMOVE&#x60; is like block but will remove offending email addresses during a send or receive event instead of blocking the action. | 
**target** | **string** | Target to match emails with. Can be a wild-card type pattern or a valid email address. For instance &#x60;*@gmail.com&#x60; matches all gmail addresses while &#x60;test@gmail.com&#x60; matches one address exactly. The target is applied to every recipient field email address when &#x60;SENDING_EMAILS&#x60; is the scope and is applied to sender of email when &#x60;RECEIVING_EMAILS&#x60;. |
